## 📋 Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** (v4.4 or higher) - [Download here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🚀 Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamalkumhar/mentormentee.git
cd mentormentee
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item .env.example .env

# On Mac/Linux
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and update the values:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mentormentee
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_this
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

⚠️ **Important**: Change `JWT_SECRET` to a random secure string!

### 4. Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
```bash
# On Windows (if MongoDB is installed as a service)
net start MongoDB

# On Mac/Linux
mongod
```

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 Important Notes

### No Dummy Data
⚠️ This application does NOT auto-populate with dummy users. All users must register through the registration forms.

- The database starts empty on first run
- Users must register manually via Student/Mentor registration pages
- The `populate-database.js` script is ONLY for testing purposes and should be run manually if needed
- No automatic dummy data is created when the server starts

### Mobile Optimization
✅ Fully responsive design for mobile devices
- Hamburger menu navigation
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized layouts for screens 480px, 768px, and 1024px+

### Deployment
⚠️ **Cannot be deployed on GitHub Pages** because:
- Requires Node.js backend server
- Needs MongoDB database
- Uses Socket.IO for real-time features

**Recommended Hosting Options:**
- [Render.com](https://render.com) - Free tier available
- [Railway.app](https://railway.app) - Free tier available
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - Paid plans
- Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) for cloud database

## 📦 Available Scripts
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with nodemon (if nodemon is installed)
- `npm run populate-db` - **[TESTING ONLY]** Manually populate database with sample users for testing
- `node scripts/clear-database.js` - Clear all data from the database

### Admin/Mentor Only
- **Database Viewer**: http://localhost:3000/database-viewer.html (Accessible only by mentors)

## Security
The database viewer is now protected and can only be accessed by:
- Authenticated users
- Users with the role of 'mentor' (teachers)

Students will be denied access to the database viewer.

## Database Population

To populate the database with sample data for testing:

```bash
npm run populate-db
```

This will create:
- 4 sample users (1 mentor, 3 students)
- 5 sample messages between users
- 2 sample meetings
- 3 sample notifications

## Database Viewer

Access the database viewer at: http://localhost:3000/database-viewer.html

The viewer allows authorized users (mentors only) to:
- See statistics overview of all data
- View users, messages, meetings, and notifications in tabular format
- Navigate through paginated data
- Switch between different data types using tabs

Unauthorized users will be:
- Redirected to the login page if not authenticated
- Shown an access denied message if they don't have the proper role
